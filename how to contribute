We have a simple implementation of search, but not quite happy with the output and part of the allocation is still done by hand. 

I'm interested in
* hearing about similar work & solutions
* suggestions for approaches
* chatting about problem details

Please post questions/ideas as issues on github, so we can all see the discussions.

Thanks!
